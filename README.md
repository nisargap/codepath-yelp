# Project 3 - *CodePath Yelp Clone*

**CodePath Yelp Clone** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

Note: I was busy creating my MHacks 7 hackathon project therefore could not work on the optionals this time. In future iterations of this project expect more optional features!

- [ ] Search results page
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [ ] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [ ] Implement the restaurant detail page.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to use multiple APIs together i.e. combine movie data with yelp data.
2. XCode Snippets are awesome!

## Video Walkthrough

## Notes

Very little challenges in making this app but it was the inspiration for my MHacks 7 hackathon project :
